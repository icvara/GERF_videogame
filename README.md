Overlab and Snake game were created by Giorgia Del Missier and Icvara Aor for the 2025 Great exhibition road festival, Imperial College London.

Overlab is a fast-paced multiplayer game inspired by Overcooked, but with a twist — instead of preparing meals, players work together to build synthetic biology experiments! Teamwork is essential to keep the lab running smoothly.
Snake is a retro-inspired game where you guide a growing “protein chain”. Instead of eating fruit, you collect amino acids, chaining them together in the right order to assemble proteins.

These game was originally developed as an outreach tool for the 2025 Great exhibition road festival, Imperial College London to introduce synthetic biology concepts in an engaging and playful way.
